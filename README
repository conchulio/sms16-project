Building
========

Under waf, just run ./waf
For a standalone build, use the 'build.sh' script.

IMPORTANT: If you wish to change the implementation of the functions that
were in the 'sms-helpers.h' file, please note that they have been split into
the 'sms-helpers.cc' file, to allow the header to be included in multiple
files.


Running
=======

Under waf, use the 'run.sh' script
Standalone, just run the 'sms-main' executable.


Output
======

Without waf, no logs are produced.
The final statistics are written to the 'results.txt' file.
This file is located either in the ns3 root dir or in the dir where the
standalone program was executed. In the same location, pcap traces are
also created.
